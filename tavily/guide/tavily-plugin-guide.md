## How It Works

The Tavily plugin integrates with SAM using the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** wrapper pattern. This means:

1. **Plugin Configuration**: The plugin is defined in a `config.yaml` file that serves both as metadata and SAM agent configuration
2. **MCP Integration**: The plugin communicates with Tavily's API through a standardized interface
3. **Natural Language Interface**: Users can perform complex searches using natural language queries through SAM
4. **Tool Abstraction**: Advanced search operations are abstracted into simple, conversational commands

## Prerequisites

Before using this plugin, you need:

1. **Solace Agent Mesh v1**: Ensure you have SAM installed and configured
2. **Tavily Account**: Sign up for a [Tavily account](https://www.tavily.com/)
3. **API Key**: Obtain your Tavily API key from your account dashboard
4. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have a proper Python environment set up

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Add the Community Plugin Repository

1. Run `sam plugin catalog` from your python virtual environment and inside your SAM directory.
2. Add the Solace Community Plugin repository:
   ![SAM Community Plugin Repository add](./assets/samCommunityRepoAdd.png)
   ```bash 
   https://github.com/solacecommunity/solace-agent-mesh-plugins
   ```

### Step 2: Install the Plugin in SAM

Use SAM's plugin installation mechanism to install the Bright Data plugin with the gui or the CLI:

*GUI* 

![Tavily Install Gui](./assets/samTavilyInstall.png)

*CLI*
```bash
sam plugin add tavily --plugin tavily
```
### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Set up your Tavily API credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export TAVILY_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"
```
### Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that the plugin is properly installed and recognized by SAM:

```bash
sam run
```

Select agent page. You should see `tavily` agent in the list of available agents.
